    <p>Affirmative action programs are often criticized because of concerns that they result in lower worker productivity and efficiency losses. We study the relative productivity of workers benefiting from an aggressive affirmative action policy in a setting where hiring constraints are especially likely to bind. In India, colleges are required to reserve approximately 50 percent of faculty hires for individuals from disadvantaged caste and social class groups. We collect and analyze data from a nationally representative sample of 50 engineering and technology colleges in India, some of which randomly assign students to classrooms. We find that reservation category faculty have lower levels of education, lower professorial ranks and fewer years of experience in academia than general category faculty who are not hired through reservations. Yet, even with lower qualifications, we find no evidence that reservation category faculty provide lower quality instruction across a wide range of measures that include course grades, follow-on course grades, standardized test scores, dropout, attendance, graduate school plans, and graduation. In fact, we find that, at least for immediate effects on course grades, students taught by reservation category faculty perform slightly better than students taught by general category faculty. We find no evidence of positive "teacher-like-me" effects of reservation category faculty on the relative course performance and longer-term outcomes of reservation category students. Furthermore, even in the face of potential discrimination and resentment against faculty hiring quotas, general category students perform slightly better in classrooms taught by reservation category faculty than general category faculty. The findings have implications for the heated debates over affirmative action programs found in many countries around the world and in India which is now the largest country in the world.</p>

    <p>We examine the effects of female faculty on both cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes of female students in STEM. Creating a novel representative dataset of engineering and technology colleges in India, we investigate the impact of exposure to female faculty on academic performance, confidence, anxiety, and gender-biased beliefs in STEM fields. In one of the first studies with random assignment to classrooms in higher education in any setting or country, we avoid problems with selection bias and other statistical pitfalls that plague many previous studies. We find that female students perform significantly better in courses taught by female instructors, with an improvement of 2.7 percentile points in course grades. Additionally, a 10 percentage point increase in female faculty exposure leads to a 0.03 standard deviation increase in standardized test scores. We also provide novel findings on non-cognitive benefits of female faculty, including a reduction in anxiety about STEM subjects and more equitable gender beliefs, particularly among male students. These findings suggest that female faculty play a crucial role in improving both academic performance and broader perceptions of gender equity in STEM, with important implications for policies aimed at reducing gender disparities in higher education and STEM fields.</p>
