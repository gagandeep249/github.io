            <p>Over the course of my PhD, I have been actively involved in teaching and mentorship. My teaching philosophy focuses on creating a supportive, inclusive learning environment where students are encouraged to engage critically and analytically with topics typically taught in economics courses, but with an emphasis on economics as a quantitative social science.</p>

            <h3>Selected Feedback</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><i>"Gagandeep was extremely helpful in guiding us through the homework material and the general course. His mannerisms, presentation of information, and how he explained it were top–notch. He was extremely helpful during office hours and went out of his way to help. His section material supplemented the class very well."</i></li>
                <li><i>"Gagandeep is super friendly and approachable. Felt like I could ask a question whenever. And whenever I did, he was helpful."</i></li>
                <li><i>"Gagandeep had a very targeted approach to helping us refine our understanding of the material. Primarily by making sure we understood what was expected through assignments."</i></li>
                <li><i>"The TA was great at explaining the material! I particularly appreciated how they explained the why behind the material and covered it all very thoroughly."</i></li>
                <li><i>"I appreciated how interactive Gagandeep made sections. It was helpful that he encouraged every student interact instead of letting one or two students answer everything. Being somewhat put on the spot, or expected to engage helped me learn and engage with the material."</i></li>
                <li><i>"Everyone in section was asked at least one question or another pertaining to the slides, which greatly helped with feeling engaged! If we got an answer wrong, Gagandeep was very encouraging and patient til we were able to find the correct solution– this was very much appreciated, it made the environment a lot less daunting. Additionally, the week of Thanksgiving when sections didn't meet, he sent us a recording of the material from the week on his own time, which was very helpful and appreciated as well! It was definitely the most engaging and enjoyable section I've been apart of."</i></li>
                <li><i>"Makes class engaging by encouraging questions. Calls on students and if they don't know the answer, he'll work it out with us. Cracks jokes to get the students to laugh, good atmosphere."</i></li>
                <li><i>"Gagandeep is extremely good at teaching intermediate microeconomics. His sections are well structured and he cultivates a welcoming environment that encourages student participation. He seems invested in his students and to genuinely care about their success. His teaching methods helped boost my confidence and helped me succeed in this class. He was able to break down concepts in ways to where I actually understood course material instead of just going through the motions of solving problems using set equations."</i></li>
                <li><i>"Gagandeep Sachdeva also made us pass around a talking stick to answer what step/ method of the question we do. This made me stay on my toes and be engaged with the material even if we would say the wrong thing Gagandeep would help guide us and learn our mistakes in a way that didn't make us scared to make mistakes."</i></li>
                <li><i>"The format of sections were very well organized – going through a slideshow every week to study concepts, which were outlined at the beginning of the slideshow itself. It helped very much to understand what our learning goals were, and the practice examples themselves were very informative!"</i></li>
